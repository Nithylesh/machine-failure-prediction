## machine-failure-prediction

This project involves building a failure prediction model using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict failures accurately by leveraging multiple algorithms and data processing methods. Below is an overview of the steps and methodologies applied:

# 1. Data Visualization
To understand the data and identify patterns, extensive data visualization techniques were employed. These visualizations helped in uncovering correlations, distributions, and potential outliers, providing a strong foundation for the subsequent modeling steps.

# 2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression was used as a baseline model. It is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification problems like failure prediction. The results from this model served as a benchmark for evaluating more complex models.

# 3. CatBoost
CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm specifically designed for categorical data, was employed to enhance the prediction accuracy. CatBoost handles categorical features effectively and reduces the need for extensive preprocessing, making it a valuable addition to the modeling process.

# 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
To address the issue of duplicate values and imbalanced data, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was utilized. KNN is effective in handling such scenarios and helps in improving the model's performance by considering the proximity of data points.

# 5. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
SMOTE was used to tackle the class imbalance problem by generating synthetic samples for the minority class. This technique ensures that the model does not become biased towards the majority class, thereby improving its ability to predict failures accurately.

# 6. Model Evaluation
All models were evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Comparative analysis was performed to identify the best-performing model.
